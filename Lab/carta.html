    <h3>Re: Eileen Dover university application </h3>
    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br/>of your <abbr title="xxxxxx">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

    <h4>Starting dates</h4>
    <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you <br/> could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 Juanary 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
    <p>You can fin more information about <a href="">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>

    <h4>Subjects of study</h4>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall<br/>somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br/>the king of person
        we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br/> by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Tunrning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefis of Reservatrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</su>.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&deg;C (86&deg;F), when the <br/>audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
        <li><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>So please can you provider more informacion on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the<br/>research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thnaks.</p>

    <h4>Exotic donce moves</h4>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal danes. To answer your question,<br/>my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance<dt/>
        <dd>A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around<br/>in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be <q>fruitful</q>.</dd>
        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dancem whitch<br/>involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffing their bodies around in imperceptably<br/>tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br/>modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
        <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
        <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 19960s believed to have<br/>discovered a new dance style characterised by <q>robotic</q> , stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitansts<br/>of Northen Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br/>because they were really cold.</dd>
        <dt>For mose of my research, see my <a href="">exotic dance research page.</a></dt>

    </dl>
    <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
    
    <br/>
